        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p> Hi, my name is Jimmaely Valdez. I am 22 years old and live in the South Bronx.<br> I am currently a student at The City College of New York; pursuing a degree in Computer Science.</br></p>
        <h3>Why I want to be a TKH Fellow:</h3>
        <p>Since high school, Iâ€™ve had a growing enthusiasm for technology.<br> Through my studies, my curiosity has pointed me towards data science and machine learning; 
        <br>however, my education has not provided me with enough guidance to break into the field.</br> </br>
         Through The Knowledge House, I hope to enhance my understanding of data science by <br>learning the fundamentals, and its applications.</br></p>
